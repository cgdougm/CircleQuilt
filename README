Circle Quilt

A sample program that exercises PyQt and PyOpenGL.

I wanted a boilerplate for quick demos that have a QMainWindow with toolbars etc.

The main widget is for OpenGL and has basic 2D texture mapped polygons.

I did it to help my wife visualize using a handful of fabric textures in a traditional circle/square pattern.

There were options I roughed in for allowing randomizationand changing the sizes. The circle radius updates in realtime.

The textures were shot with a ruler so that the inches/pixel real-world size could be maintained, hence the heads-up display is accurate.

This should work if you have PyOpenGL and PyQt installed.
